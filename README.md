## Description

Have you ever gone out and then the next thing you know it, you ran out of money because you thought, $5 here wouldn't hurt and another $10 here buying boba tea sounds like pennies but then come to find out at the end of the day that you have no more money left in the bank? This budget tracker could be the application to solve your problems. Inputting every single thing into the app will help you keep track of your money to prevent overspending. There is even a nice graph to help visualize your spending or if you like seeing the graph go up, your frugal savings. If anything, hopefully this application can help you make conscious and finanically responsible decisions.
